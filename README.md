# Using AWS Copilot to deploy to Fargate using Amazon Cognito for authentication.

This repo represents the collection of my effort to deploy a simple python application to AWS Fargate with a public page and a private page.  The private page can be accessed after registration and authentication with Amazon Cognito.   The application uses AWS copilot as a tool to create all the AWS infrastructure needed and manage the deployment.   

Future updates will include:
  - the addition of a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline.
  - the addition of a login page using Amazon Cognito.
  - the use of other OIDC providers for authentication like Facebook, Google, and Amazon

If you find this useful, I would appreciate you starring the repo.  If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnlafata)

## build locally
docker build . -t  python-web 

## test locally 

( should be able to get to the main page only unless you setup copilot manually to use the following )
 - localhost/authorize as redirect url and 
 - localhost/logout as logout url)
 - also set USER_POOL_ID and USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID in an .env 

```
docker run --name=python-web --rm -p 8080:8080 python-web
```
### prerequisites
- ensure that you have an ECR registry in AWS
- AWS CLI installed
- Docker Desktop installed
- AWS copilot installed
- non root account AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET in AWS Profile
  - instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html 
  - for example: create an alternate IAM user via the console, 
```
export AWS_PROFILE=my-app
```

### Usage
These are the basic stages to fargate deployment with AWS copilot

`copilot init` to create the app

`copilot svc init` to create the service

`copilot env init` to create the environment

`copilot app deploy` to deploy the app to the environment

You can pass the parameters in the command line if you want as follows, when prompted to create the environment, say no.

  ```
  copilot app init                   \
    python-web                       \
    --domain       'k8s-kloud.com'           
  ```

```


after the domain is initialized. You can associate the deployment information

``` 
  copilot init                                   \
    --app          python-web                    \

  Note: It's best to run this command in the root of your Git repository.
  Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
  to help you get set up with a containerized application on AWS. An application is a collection of
  containerized services that operate together.

  Ok great, we'll set up a Load Balanced Web Service named doc-processor in application doc-processor.

  Note: Architecture type arm64 has been detected. We will set platform 'linux/x86_64' instead. If you'd rather build and run as architecture type arm64, please change the 'platform' field in your workload manifest to 'linux/arm64'.
  âœ” Wrote the manifest for service doc-processor at copilot/doc-processor/manifest.yml
  Your manifest contains configurations like your container size and port.

  - Update regional resources with stack set "doc-processor-infrastructure"  [succeeded]  [0.0s]
  All right, you're all set for local development.
  Deploy: No

  No problem, you can deploy your service later:
  - Run `copilot env init` to create your environment.
  - Run `copilot deploy` to deploy your service.

### create environment

Use the appropriate AWS Profile for your configuration in the following

  ```
  copilot env init              \
    --app 'python-web'            \
    --name 'qa'                  \
    --profile 'fargate-sandbox'         \
    --container-insights          \
    --default-config
  ```

  ```

## deploy the env, the --no-rollback is useful to help debug any problems if it fails, but it's optional

  ```
  copilot env deploy      \
    --app python-web        \
    --name qa              \
    --no-rollback
